This is the Candy Crush clone with slight changes. The main differences are that the candies are represented by rectangles,
to swap between rectangles, you must tap the first one to move then second one to move, and the max points is 100 points.
In order to swap between rectangles, the codes and saves the first place you click. You then click on the second place you want to move
on the board. If you clicked outside the board, it still saves the first place you click. If nothing happens, it is either the move was
not valid or you clicked on the same piece twice.
